# am-robot
Package for using a Franka Emika Panda robot maniplator for additive manufacturing. Done as part of two student projects:
| Project               | Commits     |

|Master's project       | 65 - latest |


## About the package
The am-robot package aims to enable additive manufacturing on a robot manipulator. The overall goal is to make it general enough that different tools can be used with different robots. A G-code file is used as input and after some pro-processing of the file, motion trajectories for the robot is generated. An FDM extruder have been used when testing, controlled by an Arduino Mega2560 over a serial connection.


## Feature summary
Features are under development and spesifics can change as the project continues...
- Parsing and pre-processing of G-code input file
- Robot motion trajectory generation from G-code targets utilizing Frankx/Ruckig
- Automatic build area level detection and non-level compensation
- Visualization of tool-path trajectories and bed level mesh
- Generalization of tool and robot choice (Still needs work)
- Non-realtime syncronization of tool to robot

## Getting started
```
pip install git+https://github.com/alejontnu/am-robot.git@main
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
pip install -e .
pytest
```
This package is built using Python 3, specifically tested on Python 3.8

### Dependencies
- plotly: For visualizion of trajectories and bed level mesh
- argparse: For parsing input arguments
- gcodeparser: For initial parsing of G-code into Dictionary object containing G-code lines and more
- numpy:
- pandas:

Franka Emika Panda robot is dependent on:
- libfranka v0.7.1: C++ library for controlling Franka Emika Panda robot. Build from source (https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/)
- frankx v0.1.1: Python wrapper around libfranka. Build from source (https://github.com/pantor/frankx) to include dependencies, Ruckig and Eigen

Arduino FDM extruder controller is dependent on:
- pyserial: For communication with the Arduino
- struct: To pack and unpack format used for serial communication

### Quick guide
Arguments taken
| Argument | info |
|----------|------|
| --host | ip string to connect to robot over ethernet |
| --tool | serial port string to open serial connection to tool controller |
| --gfile | G-code file string, can be with or without the .gcode extension |
| --visualize | Enables visualization of tool path trajectories and bed level mesh. Default: False |
| --skip_connection | Skips connection to robot. Useful if only visualizing G-code or if no robot is physically connected. Default: False |


Initial machine commands in G-code:
```G-code
G28 ; home all axes
G1 Z5 F5000 ; lift nozzle
M107 ; enable fan
M104 S200 ; set temperature
```
This is so that homing and bed probing can be done before nozzle is heated up.


## Current status
Preliminary result show need for better control of the extrusion process. As can be seen in the test print below, motion trajectories are aborted if the robot encounters an error (such as acceleration contraint violation) and the remainder of the motion trajectory is left incomplete.

## Future plans
- Currently up to user to determine feasable build area size, can possibly implement an automatic check for this.
- Convert to true 3D with use of additional DoF. Currently building 2.5D layer-by-layer.
- Make the extrusion process follow tool-head trajectory in real-time.
- Improve the interval generating method used to determine motion trajectory segments

## Known issues
- Different slicer software result in inconsistent pre-processing of the G-code generated.
- Bed probing method leaves toolhead with an offset from where it should be placed.
- Motion trajectories are sometimes aborted when an robot error is detected, need to reduce or handle such cases.
